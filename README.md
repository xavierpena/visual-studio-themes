# visual-studio-themes

Compilation of themes for visual studio.

I prefer `.vssettings`, which can be imported directly into visual studio. I prefer them over `.vstheme`, which needs the extension Color Theme Editor.

I wanted to have the Monokai theme in the code, but keep the Light theme for all other features of VisualStudio.
